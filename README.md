# BDA5015.7 â€“ Data Visualization Project

This repository contains the code, visualizations, and findings for our project in the BDA5015.7 course. The project focuses on using data visualization techniques to explore and communicate insights from a dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to present clear, accurate, and engaging visualizations that support data-driven insights. We use Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas` for analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Contents
- `notebooks/` â€” Jupyter Notebooks with data processing and visualization code
- `images/` â€” Exported charts and plots
- `data/` â€” Cleaned dataset(s) used in the project
- `README.md` â€” This file

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visualizations
*(You can upload images of your charts later and insert them like this)*

```markdown
![Bar Chart](images/bar_chart.png)

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **Dataset:** Shopping Mall Paid Search Campaign (Kaggle)
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- **Participants:** 40 students with prior exposure to data visualization
- **Platform:** Kahoot (timed quiz)
- **Tasks:** Ranking, comparison, ROI analysis
- **Charts Used:** Bar, Pie, Scatter, Bubble, Radar

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Visualizations

> *(Images will render once you upload them in the `images/` folder)*

### Q1 â€“ Bar Chart vs Pie Chart

### Q4 â€“ Grouped Bar Chart vs Radar Plot

## ðŸ§  Theoretical Framework

- **Kahneman's Dual-Process Theory (2011)**
- **Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)**
- **Graphical Perception Theory (Cleveland & McGill, 1984)**
- **Tool Familiarity Hypothesis**

---

## ðŸ§ª Key Findings

- **Bar and Scatter Plots** outperformed other chart types in both speed and accuracy.
- **Radar and Pie Charts** caused significant delays and interpretation errors.
- **Programming Background Matters:** R users showed higher performance in some complex charts due to ggplot2 familiarity.
- **Simple Visuals Win** under time pressure (position & length encoding more effective than angle & area).
